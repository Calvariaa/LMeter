This should be considered an alpha release. Errors loading configs are not expected to happen, but in an abundance of caution, this release is being held from general availability until more user testing is done.\n\nOn Windows, the LMeter config can be found at: \n`%APPDATA%\\XIVLauncher\\pluginConfigs\\LMeter\\LMeter.json`\nand on Linux / Mac OS it can be found in:\n`~/.xlcore/pluginConfigs/LMeter/LMeter.json`\n- Add better connection status UI to make diagnosing errors during connection to ACT/IINACT easier to understand\n- Add option to delay connecting to ACT/IINACT until after logging into a character\n- Internal refactoring which should minorly improve performance, more to come in future updates.",
